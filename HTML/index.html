    LeetCode offers both free and premium access options. While free users have access to a limited number of questions, premium users gain access to additional questions previously used in interviews at large tech companies.[1] The performance of users' solutions is evaluated based on response speed and solution efficiency, and is ranked against other submissions in the LeetCode database.[6]
Additionally, LeetCode provides its users with mock interviews and online assessments. LeetCode hosts weekly and biweekly contests, each having 4 problems.[4][7] After you participate in a contest for the first time, you get assigned a ranking, which can be found in the profile.[8] LeetCode also provides its users with daily challenges, following UTC, with a lucky draw at the end of each month for those who stayed consistent for the month.[9]
LeetCode supports multiple programming languages, including Java, Python, JavaScript, and C.[10] The platform features forums where users can engage in discussions related to problems, the interview process, and share their interview experiences.[4]
